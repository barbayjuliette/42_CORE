# Libft

This is the first project of 42 Common Core.

In this project, we have to create our library with useful C functions that we will be allowed to use in some of our future projects.
For each of our projects, the C functions we can use are limited.
Here we recreate useful C functions, to understand how they work before we use them in the future. 

For those functions, we are not allowed to use any standard C functions, except for a few that require malloc or write.

## Libc functions
The functions must have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference is their names. They will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix.

• isalpha
• isdigit
• isalnum
• isascii
• isprint
• strlen
• memset
• bzero
• memcpy
• memmove
• strlcpy
• strlcat
• toupper
• tolower
• strchr
• strrchr
• strncmp
• memchr
• memcmp
• strnstr
• atoi
• calloc
• strdup

## Additional functions
Functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.
The expected behavior of each function is written in the corresponding file.

• ft_substr
• ft_strjoin
• ft_strtrim
• ft_split
• ft_itoa
• ft_strmapi
• ft_striteri
• ft_putchar_fd
• ft_putstr_fd
• ft_put_endl_fd
• ft_putnbr_fd

## Bonus
The last batch of functions we have to develop are useful linked list functions.
The expected behavior of each function is written in the corresponding file.

• ft_lstnew
• ft_lstadd_front
• ft_lstsize
• ft_lstlast
• ft_lstadd_back
• ft_lstdel_one
• ft_lstclear
• ft_lstiter
• ft_lstmap
