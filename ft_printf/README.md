# ft_printf

In this project, we have to reproduce the famous C function printf.

## Specifications

- We do not have to implement the buffer management of the original printf
- We have to implement the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

## Allowed functions

We are allowed to use our libft and the following functions:
malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end

## Takeaways

This was a fun project that taught me about variadic functions. 
It also allowed me to have a deeper understanding of the original printf.
