# Born2beRoot

This project is an introduction to the world of virtualization.
I had to set up a virtual machine using either DebianOS, and configure the operating system with a specific configuration, as requested by the subject..

This project was very different from the other project, everything was quite new to me.
It allowed me get more familiar with concepts like: LVM, partitions, Firewall, AppArmor, SSH, security, etc
